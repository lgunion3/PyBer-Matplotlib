# PyBer Ride Share Analysis using Matplotlib
## Overview
Iâ€™ve been tasked with analyzing ride-sharing data in different types of cities. In addition, I must create visualizations for a presentation to convey my findings while using matplotlib and the pandas library. Overall the types of cites will be analyzed on parameters that will assess affordability. 
### Preprocessing
The three types of cities are classified as Rural, Suburban, and Urban. The cost per ride, cost per driver, and ride frequency all serve as helpful parameters to understanding affordability amount the types of cities. To get this information in one data set, two data sets were merged into one. The merged data set is used to complete the analysis.
## Results
Urban cities have the highest total number of rides and drivers and consequently have the highest total fares. In contrast, rural cities had the lowest total number of rides and drivers which resulted in a higher average fare per ride. In addition, drivers in rural areas made the most money per ride.

## Conclusion 
To make ride-sharing more affordable in rural areas I would suggest lowering the cost, which may result in more usage overall. Next, I would suggest increasing the prices in the urban areas since there is a high demand for them. This will probably make the drivers happier as well. Lastly, I'd suggest incentivizing existing drivers to do nearby rural cities so the service can be more accessible to those in the area. At the moment rural areas have the lowest access and highest prices for ride-sharing.
